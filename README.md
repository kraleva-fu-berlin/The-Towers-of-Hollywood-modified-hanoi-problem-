# The-Towers-of-Hollywood-modified-hanoi-problem-
Here i will present you with my solution and code to the modified hanoi towers problem, containing a complexity analysis for the algorithm as well as python code for it and the explanation how it works.
My solution is based upon few things,here are some of them: 1st. As i started, I noticed,that with the reach of every bigger element we should transfer all of the blocks in the same order to this element.This means from uptop,to bottom,so that we can free up space for the next element. 2nd. As we've already reched the last element, we should start bringing the disks in the same order,which means, we should get the disk,that is on the bottom.For this reason we have to remove all other disks.The thing that is absolutely one advantage for us,is that everytime we should put the n-1 th disk on top ot the n-th we must only get all the disks from above to another rod,because of the fact,that the disk on top is always the second largest (meaning the n-2-th disk).We just switch the rods,as we've reached the last disk.
